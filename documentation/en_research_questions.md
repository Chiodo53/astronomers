## Research Agenda

Taking an exploratory approach, we aim to propose a simplified representation of the structure of the scientific field of astronomy and its evolution over time, based on Pierre Bourdieu's concepts of "[field](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champ_(sociology))" and "[habitus](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitus_(sociology))". We will focus on the socio-demographic profiles and intellectual positions of the agents, as well as their organizational membership and the resulting networks of relationships between actors and organizations. We will also endeavor to propose a model of how this structure evolves over time. Furthermore, as part of a prosopographic approach, we will systematically collect data on the characteristics of the agents to highlight their biographical and activity profiles.

## Research questions
* Is there a correlation or specificity in career paths based on social background, country of origin, or generation?
* Is there a relationship between professions (teachers, instrument makers, etc.) and socio-demographic characteristics?
* How has membership in organizations or more informal movements evolvedâ€”again in relation to socio-demographic factors?
* What structural relationships can be observed between organizations, and how have they evolved over time?
* What influences of intellectual affiliation or profession, or master-student or hierarchical relationships, structure the field in its temporal evolution? Are schools or movements emerging?
* How do socio-demographic factors and other structural aspects of the field influence (or result from) the sphere of publications (literary genres, themes, publishers, etc.)?


## Aspects of the information to be collected

* Education
* Teaching and activities related to astronomy
* Other successive occupations
* Membership of institutions (academies, etc.)
* Activities outside of professional activity
* Publications and their fields/subjects
* Correspondence and networks of acquaintances
